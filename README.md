About Me
My name is Dantrell Koby Rivera, and I’m currently a high school junior with a passion for computer science and technology. I began my programming journey with C++, which helped me understand the foundations of coding. Since then, I’ve expanded into web development, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy building interactive, visually engaging web applications, and I’m excited to continue developing my skills and working on more advanced projects in the future.

Project Summary
This portfolio represents the culmination of my work and learning throughout the school year. It serves as a showcase of the web development skills I've acquired and the projects I’ve created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In building this site, I gained experience in creating responsive layouts, writing clean and maintainable code, and designing dynamic, user-friendly web interfaces. This project reflects my growth as a student developer and my ability to bring ideas to life through code.

Portfolio Overview
The final portfolio website includes the following features:

Responsive Layout: Optimized for viewing on various devices using responsive design techniques.

About Me Section: A brief introduction to who I am and my goals as a developer.

Project Gallery: A section dedicated to showcasing the JavaScript projects I’ve built, each with a description and preview.

Interactive Elements: Functional features like games and tools, built with JavaScript, to demonstrate real-world application of my skills.

Deployed Online: The site is live and accessible via GitHub Pages for public viewing.

Featured Projects
1. Analog Clock
This is a real-time analog clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays the current time with accurate hour, minute, and second hands. The clock dynamically updates every second, and it helped me learn about DOM manipulation and CSS transforms.

2. Calculator
A fully functional calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator uses JavaScript for logic and real-time input handling. Building this project taught me how to manage user input and perform calculations within a clean interface.

3. Dino Run Game
An endless runner game inspired by the Chrome “Dino” game. This version features a custom character and background, adding a personal touch. The game uses JavaScript to handle key events, collision detection, and scoring. It helped me understand event-driven programming and basic game mechanics.
