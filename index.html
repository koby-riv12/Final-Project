       <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h2>Hello! My name is Dantrell Koby Rivera. I'm a junior in high school that decided to learn computer science. It has certainly been a challenge learning a range of different languages and applications. I had no knowledge on what it meant to code and the process, then I started learning C++ then I became familiar of key concepts such as variables and what it meant to use HTML, Javascript, and CSS, and this website shows some of my best work.</h2>
